Bright Network's coding boot camp - Couch to coder using Python

Couch to Coder Bootcamp documentation I started my journey with coding using Python with Bright Network coding bootcamp: Couch to coder. This was a great way to begin my journey into coding using python and to develop my skills for data analytics/data science.

Consisted of a 4 week programme:

Week 1: Laying the Foundations. Got an introduction to python worked with conditional logic and conditional flows.

Week 2: Expand your Horizons. Advanced data structures with lists, dictionaries, and loops.

Week 3: Unlocking the Power of Algorithms. 3rd party packages, research techniques and functions. Solving real problems using python.

Week 4: Dive into Data Analysis. Basic data analysis and read from files/write from files using python. Also used pandas and matplotlib to make pie charts and bar charts.

Task 4: Data Analysis of Volkswagen cars. I answered the following questions:

What is the most expensive VW car listed?
Find all the VW Golf models. What is their average price?
What is the average milage for VW Polo models registered in 2020?
Also I created a pie chart and bar chart using pandas and matplotlib. The pie chart highlighting the distribution of the fuel types in the dataset. The bar chart highlighting the average mileage for Volkswagen cars.
